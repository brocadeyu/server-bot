Web performance is how long a site takes to load, become interactive and responsive, and how smooth the content is during user interactions - is the scrolling smooth? are buttons clickable? Are pop-ups quick to load and display, and do they animate smoothly as they do so? Web performance includes both objective measurements like time to load, frames per second, and time to become interactive, and subjective experiences of how long it felt like it took the content to load.","popularity":0.0082,"modified":"2020-12-09T10:23:54.752Z","other_translations":[],"pageType":"landing-page","source":{"folder":"en-us/web/performance","github_url":"https://github.com/mdn/content/blob/main/files/en-us/web/performance/index.md","last_commit_url":"https://github.com/mdn/content/commit/null","filename":"index.md"},"short_title":"Web performance","parents":[{"uri":"/en-US/docs/Web","title":"References"},{"uri":"/en-US/docs/Web/Performance","title":"Web performance"}],"pageTitle":"Web performance | MDN","noIndexing":false,"hash":"beee7bc3e866391adf981d45f755c8207427b68f13e730dfa75ce333305052a7"}

<p>HTML provides a <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/img#crossorigin"><code>crossorigin</code></a> attribute for images that, in combination with an appropriate <a href="/en-US/docs/Glossary/CORS">CORS</a> header, allows images defined by the <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/img"><code>&lt;img&gt;</code></a> element that are loaded from foreign origins to be used in a <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/canvas"><code>&lt;canvas&gt;</code></a> as if they had been loaded from the current origin.</p>
<p>See <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Attributes/crossorigin">CORS settings attributes</a> for details on how the <code>crossorigin</code> attribute is used.</p>
<h2 id="security_and_tainted_canvases">Security and tainted canvases</h2>
<p>Because the pixels in a canvas's bitmap can come from a variety of sources, including images or videos retrieved from other hosts, it's inevitable that security problems may arise.</p>
<p>As soon as you draw into a canvas any data that was loaded from another origin without CORS approval, the canvas becomes <strong>tainted</strong>. A tainted canvas is one which is no longer considered secure, and any attempts to retrieve image data back from the canvas will cause an exception to be thrown.</p>
<p>If the source of the foreign content is an HTML <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/img"><code>&lt;img&gt;</code></a> or SVG <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/Element/svg"><code>&lt;svg&gt;</code></a> element, attempting to retrieve the contents of the canvas isn't allowed.</p>
<p>If the foreign content comes from an image obtained from either as <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLCanvasElement"><code>HTMLCanvasElement</code></a> or <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/API/ImageBitmap"><code>ImageBitMap</code></a>, and the image source doesn't meet the same origin rules, attempts to read the canvas's contents are blocked.</p>
<p>Calling any of the following on a tainted canvas will result in an error:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Calling <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/API/CanvasRenderingContext2D/getImageData" title="getImageData()"><code>getImageData()</code></a> on the canvas's context</li>
  <li>Calling <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLCanvasElement/toBlob" title="toBlob()"><code>toBlob()</code></a>, <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLCanvasElement/toDataURL" title="toDataURL()"><code>toDataURL()</code></a> or <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLCanvasElement/captureStream" title="captureStream()"><code>captureStream()</code></a> on the <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/canvas"><code>&lt;canvas&gt;</code></a> element itself</li>
</ul>
<p>Attempting any of these when the canvas is tainted will cause a <code>SecurityError</code> to be thrown. This protects users from having private data exposed by using images to pull information from remote websites without permission.</p>
<h2 id="storing_an_image_from_a_foreign_origin">Storing an image from a foreign origin</h2>
<p>In this example, we wish to permit images from a foreign origin to be retrieved and saved to local storage. Implementing this requires configuring the server as well as writing code for the website itself.</p>
<h3 id="web_server_configuration">Web server configuration</h3>
<p>The first thing we need is a server that's configured to host images with the <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Access-Control-Allow-Origin"><code>Access-Control-Allow-Origin</code></a> header configured to permit cross-origin access to image files.</p>
<p>Let's assume we're serving our site using <a href="https://httpd.apache.org/">Apache</a>. Consider the HTML5 Boilerplate <a href="https://github.com/h5bp/server-configs-apache/blob/main/h5bp/cross-origin/images.conf">Apache server configuration file for CORS images</a>, shown below:</p>
<pre class="brush: xml">&lt;IfModule mod_setenvif.c&gt;
  &lt;IfModule mod_headers.c&gt;
    &lt;FilesMatch "\.(avifs?|bmp|cur|gif|ico|jpe?g|jxl|a?png|svgz?|webp)$"&gt;
      SetEnvIf Origin ":" IS_CORS
      Header set Access-Control-Allow-Origin "*" env=IS_CORS
    &lt;/FilesMatch&gt;
  &lt;/IfModule&gt;
&lt;/IfModule&gt;
</pre>
<p>In short, this configures the server to allow graphic files (those with the extensions ".bmp", ".cur", ".gif", ".ico", ".jpg", ".jpeg", ".png", ".svg", ".svgz", and ".webp") to be accessed cross-origin from anywhere on the internet.</p>
<h3 id="implementing_the_save_feature">Implementing the save feature</h3>
<p>Now that the server has been configured to allow retrieval of the images cross-origin, we can write the code that allows the user to save them to <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Storage_API">local storage</a>, just as if they were being served from the same domain the code is running on.</p>
<p>The key is to use the <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/img#crossorigin"><code>crossorigin</code></a> attribute by setting <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLImageElement/crossOrigin" title="crossOrigin"><code>crossOrigin</code></a> on the <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLImageElement"><code>HTMLImageElement</code></a> into which the image will be loaded. This tells the browser to request cross-origin access when downloading the image data.</p>
<h4 id="starting_the_download">Starting the download</h4>
<p>The code that starts the download (say, when the user clicks a "Download" button), looks like this:</p>
<pre class="brush: js">function startDownload() {
  let imageURL =
    "https://cdn.glitch.com/4c9ebeb9-8b9a-4adc-ad0a-238d9ae00bb5%2Fmdn_logo-only_color.svg?1535749917189";
  let imageDescription = "The Mozilla logo";

  downloadedImg = new Image();
  downloadedImg.crossOrigin = "anonymous";
  downloadedImg.addEventListener("load", imageReceived, false);
  downloadedImg.alt = imageDescription;
  downloadedImg.src = imageURL;
}
</pre>
<p>We're using a hard-coded URL (<code>imageURL</code>) and associated descriptive text (<code>imageDescription</code>) here, but that could easily come from anywhere. To begin downloading the image, we create a new <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLImageElement"><code>HTMLImageElement</code></a> object by using the <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLImageElement/Image" title="Image()"><code>Image()</code></a> constructor. The image is then configured to allow cross-origin downloading by setting its <code>crossOrigin</code> attribute to <code>"anonymous"</code> (that is, allow non-authenticated downloading of the image cross-origin). An event listener is added for the <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/load_event" title="load"><code>load</code></a> event being fired on the image element, which means the image data has been received. Alternative text is added to the image; while <code>&lt;canvas&gt;</code> does not support the <code>alt</code> attribute, the value can be used to set an <code>aria-label</code> or the canvas's inner content.</p>
<p>Finally, the image's <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLImageElement/src" title="src"><code>src</code></a> attribute is set to the URL of the image to download; this triggers the download to begin.</p>
<h4 id="receiving_and_saving_the_image">Receiving and saving the image</h4>
<p>The code that handles the newly-downloaded image is found in the <code>imageReceived()</code> method:</p>
<pre class="brush: js">function imageReceived() {
  const canvas = document.createElement("canvas");
  const context = canvas.getContext("2d");

  canvas.width = downloadedImg.width;
  canvas.height = downloadedImg.height;
  canvas.innerText = downloadedImg.alt;

  context.drawImage(downloadedImg, 0, 0);
  imageBox.appendChild(canvas);

  try {
    localStorage.setItem("saved-image-example", canvas.toDataURL("image/png"));
  } catch (err) {
    console.error(`Error: ${err}`);
  }
}
</pre>
<p><code>imageReceived()</code> is called to handle the <code>"load"</code> event on the <code>HTMLImageElement</code> that receives the downloaded image. This event is triggered once the downloaded data is all available. It begins by creating a new <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/canvas"><code>&lt;canvas&gt;</code></a> element that we'll use to convert the image into a data URL, and by getting access to the canvas's 2D drawing context (<a href="/en-US/docs/Web/API/CanvasRenderingContext2D"><code>CanvasRenderingContext2D</code></a>) in the variable <code>context</code>.</p>
<p>The canvas's size is adjusted to match the received image, the inner text is set to the image description, then the image is drawn into the canvas using <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/API/CanvasRenderingContext2D/drawImage" title="drawImage()"><code>drawImage()</code></a>. The canvas is then inserted into the document so the image is visible.</p>
<p>Now it's time to actually save the image locally. To do this, we use the Web Storage API's local storage mechanism, which is accessed through the <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/localStorage" title="localStorage"><code>localStorage</code></a> global. The canvas method <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLCanvasElement/toDataURL" title="toDataURL()"><code>toDataURL()</code></a> is used to convert the image into a data:// URL representing a PNG image, which is then saved into local storage using <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/API/Storage/setItem" title="setItem()"><code>setItem()</code></a>.</p>

<p>Any WebDriver <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/WebDriver/Commands">command</a> that is sent to might plausibly receive an error <a class="page-not-created" title="The documentation about this has not yet been written; please consider contributing!" data-href="/en-US/docs/Web/WebDriver/Response" data-flaw="link1">response</a>. An error is represented by an <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP">HTTP response</a> with an <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status">HTTP status code</a> in the 4xx or 5xx range, and a JSON payload holding details of the error.</p>
<h2 id="payload">Payload</h2>
<p>The <strong>error object</strong> is a JSON Object that bears three, and sometimes four, fields:</p>
<dl>
  <dt id="error"><a href="#error"><code>error</code></a></dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Error type.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt id="message"><a href="#message"><code>message</code></a></dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Human-readable description of the nature of the error.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt id="stacktrace"><a href="#stacktrace"><code>stacktrace</code></a></dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Stacktrace report of the active stack frames at the time when the error occurred.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt id="data"><a href="#data"><code>data</code></a> (optional)</dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Arbitrary and implementation-defined data that it can be useful to present the user with.</p>
    <p>Many drivers include the <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/alert">user prompt</a>'s text when encountering an <a class="page-not-created" title="The documentation about this has not yet been written; please consider contributing!" data-href="/en-US/docs/Web/WebDriver/Errors/UnexpectedAlertOpen" data-flaw="link2">unexpected alert open</a> error.</p>
  </dd>
</dl>
<h2 id="example">Example</h2>
<p>For example a <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Methods/GET"><code>GET</code></a> request to <code>/session/1234/url</code>, where <code>1234</code> is a bogus session, would return a response with the <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status/404"><code>404 Not Found</code></a> status and the following body:</p>
<pre class="brush: json">{
  "value": {
    "error": "invalid session id",
    "message": "No active session with ID 1234",
    "stacktrace": ""
  }
}
</pre>
<p>It is optional for the driver to annotate errors with additional error data. Notably, this is common when a user prompt, such as <code>window.alert</code>, has opened a modal dialog after execution of your previous WebDriver command request.</p>
<p>Because both WebDriver and JavaScript execution is halted by such a dialog, we see an <a class="page-not-created" title="The documentation about this has not yet been written; please consider contributing!" data-href="/en-US/docs/Web/WebDriver/Errors/UnexpectedAlertOpen" data-flaw="link3">unexpected alert open</a> error in the subsequent response:</p>
<pre class="brush: json">{
  "value": {
    "error": "unexpected alert open",
    "message": "",
    "stacktrace": "",
    "data": {
      "text": "Message from window.alert"
    }
  }
}
</pre>
<p>In most <a class="page-not-created" title="The documentation about this has not yet been written; please consider contributing!" data-href="/en-US/docs/Web/WebDriver/Clients" data-flaw="link4">clients</a> the error would be represented by some sort of error <em>type</em> or <em>object representation</em>. In Python it is represented as a <a href="https://www.selenium.dev/selenium/docs/api/py/common/selenium.common.exceptions.html"><code>WebDriverException</code></a>, in Node.js as a <a href="https://www.selenium.dev/selenium/docs/api/javascript/WebDriverError.html"><code>WebDriverError</code></a>, and in Java also as a <a href="https://www.selenium.dev/selenium/docs/api/java/org/openqa/selenium/WebDriverException.html"><code>WebDriverException</code></a>.</p>

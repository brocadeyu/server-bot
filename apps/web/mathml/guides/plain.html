<p>The following guides provide a gentle beginning to your path towards MathML mastery with the basics of how it works, what the syntax looks like, and how you can start using it inside HTML.</p>
<h2 id="guides">Guides</h2>
<dl>
  <dt id="getting_started_with_mathml"><a href="/en-US/docs/Web/MathML/Guides/Getting_started">Getting started with MathML</a></dt>
  <dd>
    <p>In this article, we will take a simple HTML document and see how to add MathML formulas into it, introducing a few elements along the way.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt id="text_containers"><a href="/en-US/docs/Web/MathML/Guides/Text_containers">Text containers</a></dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Now that you get a better idea of MathML, we move on to text containers (variables, numbers, operators, ...) which are used as building blocks of MathML formulas.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt id="fractions_and_roots"><a href="/en-US/docs/Web/MathML/Guides/Fractions_and_roots">Fractions and roots</a></dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Relying on text containers, this article describes how to build more complex MathML expressions by nesting fractions and roots.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt id="scripts"><a href="/en-US/docs/Web/MathML/Guides/Scripts">Scripts</a></dt>
  <dd>
    <p>We continue the review of basic math notations and focuses on building MathML elements with scripts.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt id="tables"><a href="/en-US/docs/Web/MathML/Guides/Tables">Tables</a></dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Once all basic math notations are known, it remains to consider tabular layout which can be used for matrix-like expressions and other advanced math layout.</p>
  </dd>

<h2 id="challenges">Challenges</h2>
<dl>
  <dt id="three_famous_mathematical_formulas"><a href="/en-US/docs/Web/MathML/Guides/Three_famous_mathematical_formulas">Three famous mathematical formulas</a></dt>
  <dd>
    <p>With the things you have learned in the last few articles, you should already be able to write relatively sophisticated MathML formulas. This challenge gives you a chance to do that.</p>

    <p>CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is the code you use to style your webpage. <em>CSS Basics</em> takes you through what you need to get started. We'll answer questions like: How do I make my text black or red? How do I make my content show up in such-and-such a place on the screen? How do I decorate my webpage with background images and colors?</p>

    <p>CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is used to style and lay out web pages — for example, to alter the font, color, size, and spacing of your content, split it into multiple columns, or add animations and other decorative features. This module provides a gentle beginning to your path toward CSS mastery with the basics of how it works, what the syntax looks like, and how you can start using it to add styling to HTML.</p>

    <p>In previous modules we looked at how to style and manipulate the boxes that your content sits inside. Now it's time to look at how to correctly lay out your boxes in relation to one another, and the browser viewport. This module looks at floats, positioning, other modern layout tools, and building responsive designs that will adapt to different devices, screen sizes, and resolutions.</p>

Now it's time to look at how to place your boxes in the right place in relation to the viewport, and one another. We have covered the necessary prerequisites so can now dive deep into CSS layout, looking at different display settings, traditional layout methods involving float and positioning, and new fangled layout tools like flexbox.</p>

    <p>In JavaScript, most things are objects, from core JavaScript features like strings and arrays to the browser APIs built on top of JavaScript. You can even create your own objects to encapsulate related functions and variables into efficient packages. The object-oriented nature of JavaScript is important to understand if you want to go further with your knowledge of the language and write more efficient code, therefore we've provided this module to help you. Here we teach object theory and syntax in detail, look at how to create your own objects, and explain what JSON data is and how to work with it.</p>

In this module, we will explore what APIs are, and how to use some of the most common APIs you'll come across often in your development work.</p>

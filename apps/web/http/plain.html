  <strong><em>Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP)</em></strong> is an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_Layer">application-layer</a> protocol for transmitting hypermedia documents, such as HTML.
  It was designed for communication between web browsers and web servers, but it can also be used for other purposes, such as machine-to-machine communication, programmatic access to APIs, and more.
</p>
<p>
  HTTP follows a classical <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Client%E2%80%93server_model">client-server model</a>, with a client opening a connection to make a request, then waiting until it receives a response from the server.
  HTTP is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stateless_protocol">stateless protocol</a>, meaning that the server does not keep any session data between two requests, although the later addition of <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Cookies">cookies</a> adds state to some client-server interactions.

<p>
  HTTP is an extensible protocol that relies on concepts like resources and Uniform Resource Identifiers (URIs), a simple message structure, and client-server communication model.
  On top of these concepts, numerous extensions have been developed over the years that add functionality and updated semantics, including additional HTTP methods and headers.

  <dt id="http_messages"><a href="/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Messages">HTTP messages</a></dt>
  <dd>
    <p>
      HTTP messages transmitted as requests and responses have a defined structure.
      This article describes this general structure, its purpose, and the different types of messages.

  <dt id="mime_types"><a href="/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/MIME_types">MIME types</a></dt>
  <dd>
    <p>
      Since HTTP/1.0, different types of content can be transmitted.
      This article explains how this is accomplished using the <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Content-Type"><code>Content-Type</code></a> header and the MIME standard.
      A shortlist of common types used by web developers can be found in <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/MIME_types/Common_types">Common MIME types</a>.
    </p>
  </dd>
  <dt id="compression_in_http"><a href="/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Compression">Compression in HTTP</a></dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Browsers and servers compress their messages before sending them over the network to reduce the amount of data that needs to be transmitted, improving transfer speed and bandwidth utilization.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt id="http_caching"><a href="/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Caching">HTTP caching</a></dt>
  <dd>
    <p>
      Caching is a highly important mechanism for delivering fast experiences on the Web and for efficient use of resources.
      This article describes different methods of caching and how to use HTTP headers to control them.
    </p>
  </dd>
  <dt id="http_authentication"><a href="/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Authentication">HTTP authentication</a></dt>
  <dd>
    <p>
      Authentication is a way to verify the identity of a client when making requests to a server.
      It ensures that only authorized users or systems can access certain resources.
    </p>
  </dd>
  <dt id="using_http_cookies"><a href="/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Cookies">Using HTTP cookies</a></dt>
  <dd>
    <p>
      Although HTTP is a stateless protocol, a server can send a <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Set-Cookie"><code>Set-Cookie</code></a> header with the response.
      The client then returns the cookie's value with every subsequent request to the server in the form of a <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Cookie"><code>Cookie</code></a> request header.
      This adds the ability to store and exchange a small amount of data which effectively adds state to some client-server interactions.
    </p>
  </dd>
  <dt id="redirections_in_http"><a href="/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Redirections">Redirections in HTTP</a></dt>
  <dd>
    <p>
      URL redirection, also known as URL forwarding, is a technique to give more than one URL address to a page, a form, a whole website, or a web application.
      HTTP has a special kind of response, called a HTTP redirect, for this operation.
    </p>
  </dd>
  <dt id="http_conditional_requests"><a href="/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Conditional_requests">HTTP conditional requests</a></dt>
  <dd>
    <p>
      In conditional requests, the outcome of a request depends on the value of a validator in the request.
      This method is used heavily in <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Caching">caching</a> and use cases such as resuming a download, preventing lost updates when modifying a document on the server, and more.
    </p>
  </dd>
  <dt id="http_range_requests"><a href="/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Range_requests">HTTP range requests</a></dt>
  <dd>
    <p>
      A range request asks the server to send a specific part (or parts) of a resource back to a client instead of the full resource.
      Range requests are useful for cases when a client knows they need only part of a large file, or for cases where an application allows the user to pause and resume a download.

  <dt id="content_negotiation"><a href="/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Content_negotiation">Content negotiation</a></dt>
  <dd>
    <p>
      HTTP defines a set of message headers, starting with <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Accept"><code>Accept</code></a> as a way for a browser to announce the format, language, or encoding it prefers.
      This article explains how this advertisement happens, how the server is expected to react, and how it chooses the most adequate response to a request.

  <dd>
    <p>
      HTTP/1.1 provides a mechanism to upgrade an already-established connection to a different protocol using the <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Upgrade"><code>Upgrade</code></a> header.
      A client can upgrade a connection from HTTP/1.1 to HTTP/2, or an HTTP(S) connection to a <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebSocket">WebSocket</a> (<code>ws</code> / <code>wss</code>).

  <dt id="http_client_hints"><a href="/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Client_hints">HTTP Client hints</a></dt>
  <dd>
    <p>
      Client Hints are a set of response headers that a server can use to proactively request information from a client about the device, network, user, and user-agent-specific preferences.
      The server can then determine which resources to send, based on the information that the client chooses to provide.

</abbr></dt>
  <dd>
    <p>
      Network Error Logging is a mechanism that can be configured via the <code>NEL</code> HTTP response header.
      This experimental header allows websites and applications to opt-in to receive reports about failed (or even successful) network fetches from supporting browsers.

  <dd>
    <p>
      Cross-site HTTP requests are requests for resources from a different domain than that of the resource making the request.
      Web pages today very commonly load cross-site resources, for example, a page 'Domain A' (<code>http://domaina.example/</code>) requests an image on 'Domain B' (<code>http://domainb.foo/image.jpg</code>) via the <code>img</code> element.
      CORS allows web developers to control how their site reacts to cross-site requests.

    <p>
      CSP allows website administrators to use the <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Content-Security-Policy"><code>Content-Security-Policy</code></a> response header to control which resources the client is allowed to load for a given page.
      The CSP guide describes the overall Content Security Policy mechanism which helps detect and mitigate certain types of attacks, including Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) and data injection attacks.

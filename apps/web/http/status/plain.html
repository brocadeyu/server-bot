<p>
  HTTP response status codes indicate whether a specific <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP">HTTP</a> request has been successfully completed.
  Responses are grouped in five classes:
</p>
<ol>
  <li><a href="#informational_responses">Informational responses</a> (<code>100</code> – <code>199</code>)</li>
  <li><a href="#successful_responses">Successful responses</a> (<code>200</code> – <code>299</code>)</li>
  <li><a href="#redirection_messages">Redirection messages</a> (<code>300</code> – <code>399</code>)</li>
  <li><a href="#client_error_responses">Client error responses</a> (<code>400</code> – <code>499</code>)</li>
  <li><a href="#server_error_responses">Server error responses</a> (<code>500</code> – <code>599</code>)</li>
</ol>
<p>The status codes listed below are defined by <a href="https://httpwg.org/specs/rfc9110.html#overview.of.status.codes">RFC 9110</a>.</p>
<div class="notecard note">
  <p><strong>Note:</strong> If you receive a response that is not listed here, it is a non-standard response, possibly custom to the server's software.</p>

    <p>This interim response indicates that the client should continue the request or ignore the response if the request is already finished.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt id="101_switching_protocols"><a href="/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status/101"><code>101 Switching Protocols</code></a></dt>

  <dd>
    <p>This code was used in <a href="/en-US/docs/Glossary/WebDAV">WebDAV</a> contexts to indicate that a request has been received by the server, but no status was available at the time of the response.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt id="103_early_hints"><a href="/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status/103"><code>103 Early Hints</code></a></dt>
  <dd>
    <p>This status code is primarily intended to be used with the <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Link"><code>Link</code></a> header, letting the user agent start <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Attributes/rel/preload">preloading</a> resources while the server prepares a response or <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Attributes/rel/preconnect">preconnect</a> to an origin from which the page will need resources.</p>
  </dd>

<h2 id="successful_responses">Successful responses</h2>
<dl>
  <dt id="200_ok"><a href="/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status/200"><code>200 OK</code></a></dt>
  <dd>
    <p>The request succeeded. The result and meaning of "success" depends on the HTTP method:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Methods/GET"><code>GET</code></a>: The resource has been fetched and transmitted in the message body.</li>
      <li><a href="/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Methods/HEAD"><code>HEAD</code></a>: Representation headers are included in the response without any message body.</li>
      <li><a href="/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Methods/PUT"><code>PUT</code></a> or <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Methods/POST"><code>POST</code></a>: The resource describing the result of the action is transmitted in the message body.</li>
      <li><a href="/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Methods/TRACE"><code>TRACE</code></a>: The message body contains the request as received by the server.</li>
    </ul>
  </dd>
  <dt id="201_created"><a href="/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status/201"><code>201 Created</code></a></dt>
  <dd>
    <p>The request succeeded, and a new resource was created as a result. This is typically the response sent after <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Methods/POST"><code>POST</code></a> requests, or some <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Methods/PUT"><code>PUT</code></a> requests.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt id="202_accepted"><a href="/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status/202"><code>202 Accepted</code></a></dt>
  <dd>
    <p>
      The request has been received but not yet acted upon.
      It is noncommittal, since there is no way in HTTP to later send an asynchronous response indicating the outcome of the request.
      It is intended for cases where another process or server handles the request, or for batch processing.

  <dt id="203_non-authoritative_information"><a href="/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status/203"><code>203 Non-Authoritative Information</code></a></dt>
  <dd>
    <p>
      This response code means the returned metadata is not exactly the same as is available from the origin server, but is collected from a local or a third-party copy.
      This is mostly used for mirrors or backups of another resource.
      Except for that specific case, the <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status/200"><code>200 OK</code></a> response is preferred to this status.
    </p>
  </dd>
  <dt id="204_no_content"><a href="/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status/204"><code>204 No Content</code></a></dt>
  <dd>
    <p>
      There is no content to send for this request, but the headers are useful.
      The user agent may update its cached headers for this resource with the new ones.
    </p>
  </dd>
  <dt id="205_reset_content"><a href="/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status/205"><code>205 Reset Content</code></a></dt>

    <p>Tells the user agent to reset the document which sent this request.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt id="206_partial_content"><a href="/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status/206"><code>206 Partial Content</code></a></dt>
  <dd>
    <p>This response code is used in response to a <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Range_requests">range request</a> when the client has requested a part or parts of a resource.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt id="207_multi-status"><a href="/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status/207"><code>207 Multi-Status</code></a> (<a href="/en-US/docs/Glossary/WebDAV">WebDAV</a>)</dt>

  <dd>
    <p>The server has fulfilled a <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Methods/GET"><code>GET</code></a> request for the resource, and the response is a representation of the result of one or more instance-manipulations applied to the current instance.</p>

<dl>
  <dt id="300_multiple_choices"><a href="/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status/300"><code>300 Multiple Choices</code></a></dt>
  <dd>
    <p>
      In <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Content_negotiation#agent-driven_negotiation">agent-driven content negotiation</a>, the request has more than one possible response and the user agent or user should choose one of them.
      There is no standardized way for clients to automatically choose one of the responses, so this is rarely used.
    </p>
  </dd>
  <dt id="301_moved_permanently"><a href="/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status/301"><code>301 Moved Permanently</code></a></dt>
  <dd>
    <p>The URL of the requested resource has been changed permanently. The new URL is given in the response.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt id="302_found"><a href="/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status/302"><code>302 Found</code></a></dt>
  <dd>
    <p>
      This response code means that the URI of requested resource has been changed <em>temporarily</em>.
      Further changes in the URI might be made in the future, so the same URI should be used by the client in future requests.
    </p>
  </dd>
  <dt id="303_see_other"><a href="/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status/303"><code>303 See Other</code></a></dt>
  <dd>
    <p>The server sent this response to direct the client to get the requested resource at another URI with a <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Methods/GET"><code>GET</code></a> request.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt id="304_not_modified"><a href="/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status/304"><code>304 Not Modified</code></a></dt>
  <dd>
    <p>
      This is used for caching purposes.
      It tells the client that the response has not been modified, so the client can continue to use the same <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Caching">cached</a> version of the response.
    </p>

  <dt id="305_use_proxy"><a href="#305_use_proxy"><code>305 Use Proxy</code></a> <abbr class="icon icon-deprecated" title="Deprecated. Not for use in new websites.">
  <span class="visually-hidden">Deprecated</span>
</abbr></dt>
  <dd>
    <p>
      Defined in a previous version of the HTTP specification to indicate that a requested response must be accessed by a proxy.
      It has been deprecated due to security concerns regarding in-band configuration of a proxy.
    </p>
  </dd>
  <dt id="306_unused"><a href="#306_unused"><code>306 unused</code></a></dt>
  <dd>
    <p>This response code is no longer used; but is reserved. It was used in a previous version of the HTTP/1.1 specification.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt id="307_temporary_redirect"><a href="/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status/307"><code>307 Temporary Redirect</code></a></dt>
  <dd>
    <p>
      The server sends this response to direct the client to get the requested resource at another URI with the same method that was used in the prior request.
      This has the same semantics as the <code>302 Found</code> response code, with the exception that the user agent <em>must not</em> change the HTTP method used: if a <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Methods/POST"><code>POST</code></a> was used in the first request, a <code>POST</code> must be used in the redirected request.
    </p>
  </dd>
  <dt id="308_permanent_redirect"><a href="/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status/308"><code>308 Permanent Redirect</code></a></dt>
  <dd>
    <p>
      This means that the resource is now permanently located at another URI, specified by the <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Location"><code>Location</code></a> response header.
      This has the same semantics as the <code>301 Moved Permanently</code> HTTP response code, with the exception that the user agent <em>must not</em> change the HTTP method used: if a <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Methods/POST"><code>POST</code></a> was used in the first request, a <code>POST</code> must be used in the second request.
    </p>
  </dd>

<h2 id="client_error_responses">Client error responses</h2>
<dl>
  <dt id="400_bad_request"><a href="/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status/400"><code>400 Bad Request</code></a></dt>
  <dd>
    <p>The server cannot or will not process the request due to something that is perceived to be a client error (e.g., malformed request syntax, invalid request message framing, or deceptive request routing).</p>
  </dd>
  <dt id="401_unauthorized"><a href="/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status/401"><code>401 Unauthorized</code></a></dt>
  <dd>
    <p>
      Although the HTTP standard specifies "unauthorized", semantically this response means "unauthenticated".
      That is, the client must authenticate itself to get the requested response.
    </p>
  </dd>
  <dt id="402_payment_required"><a href="/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status/402"><code>402 Payment Required</code></a></dt>
  <dd>
    <p>The initial purpose of this code was for digital payment systems, however this status code is rarely used and no standard convention exists.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt id="403_forbidden"><a href="/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status/403"><code>403 Forbidden</code></a></dt>
  <dd>
    <p>
      The client does not have access rights to the content; that is, it is unauthorized, so the server is refusing to give the requested resource.
      Unlike <code>401 Unauthorized</code>, the client's identity is known to the server.
    </p>
  </dd>
  <dt id="404_not_found"><a href="/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status/404"><code>404 Not Found</code></a></dt>
  <dd>
    <p>
      The server cannot find the requested resource.
      In the browser, this means the URL is not recognized.
      In an API, this can also mean that the endpoint is valid but the resource itself does not exist.
      Servers may also send this response instead of <code>403 Forbidden</code> to hide the existence of a resource from an unauthorized client.
      This response code is probably the most well known due to its frequent occurrence on the web.
    </p>
  </dd>
  <dt id="405_method_not_allowed"><a href="/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status/405"><code>405 Method Not Allowed</code></a></dt>
  <dd>
    <p>
      The <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Methods">request method</a> is known by the server but is not supported by the target resource.
      For example, an API may not allow <code>DELETE</code> on a resource, or the <code>TRACE</code> method entirely.
    </p>
  </dd>
  <dt id="406_not_acceptable"><a href="/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status/406"><code>406 Not Acceptable</code></a></dt>
  <dd>
    <p>This response is sent when the web server, after performing <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Content_negotiation#server-driven_content_negotiation">server-driven content negotiation</a>, doesn't find any content that conforms to the criteria given by the user agent.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt id="407_proxy_authentication_required"><a href="/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status/407"><code>407 Proxy Authentication Required</code></a></dt>
  <dd>
    <p>This is similar to <code>401 Unauthorized</code> but authentication is needed to be done by a proxy.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt id="408_request_timeout"><a href="/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status/408"><code>408 Request Timeout</code></a></dt>
  <dd>
    <p>
      This response is sent on an idle connection by some servers, even without any previous request by the client.
      It means that the server would like to shut down this unused connection.
      This response is used much more since some browsers use HTTP pre-connection mechanisms to speed up browsing.
      Some servers may shut down a connection without sending this message.
    </p>
  </dd>
  <dt id="409_conflict"><a href="/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status/409"><code>409 Conflict</code></a></dt>
  <dd>
    <p>
      This response is sent when a request conflicts with the current state of the server.
      In <a href="/en-US/docs/Glossary/WebDAV">WebDAV</a> remote web authoring, <code>409</code> responses are errors sent to the client so that a user might be able to resolve a conflict and resubmit the request.
    </p>
  </dd>
  <dt id="410_gone"><a href="/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status/410"><code>410 Gone</code></a></dt>
  <dd>
    <p>
      This response is sent when the requested content has been permanently deleted from server, with no forwarding address.
      Clients are expected to remove their caches and links to the resource.
      The HTTP specification intends this status code to be used for "limited-time, promotional services".
      APIs should not feel compelled to indicate resources that have been deleted with this status code.
    </p>
  </dd>
  <dt id="411_length_required"><a href="/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status/411"><code>411 Length Required</code></a></dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Server rejected the request because the <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Content-Length"><code>Content-Length</code></a> header field is not defined and the server requires it.</p>

  <dd>
    <p>In <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Conditional_requests">conditional requests</a>, the client has indicated preconditions in its headers which the server does not meet.</p>

  <dt id="413_content_too_large"><a href="/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status/413"><code>413 Content Too Large</code></a></dt>
  <dd>
    <p>
      The request body is larger than limits defined by server.
      The server might close the connection or return an <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Retry-After"><code>Retry-After</code></a> header field.
    </p>
  </dd>
  <dt id="414_uri_too_long"><a href="/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status/414"><code>414 URI Too Long</code></a></dt>

  <dd>
    <p>The media format of the requested data is not supported by the server, so the server is rejecting the request.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt id="416_range_not_satisfiable"><a href="/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status/416"><code>416 Range Not Satisfiable</code></a></dt>
  <dd>
    <p>
      The <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Range_requests">ranges</a> specified by the <code>Range</code> header field in the request cannot be fulfilled.
      It's possible that the range is outside the size of the target resource's data.

      The origin server requires the request to be <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Conditional_requests">conditional</a>.
      This response is intended to prevent the 'lost update' problem, where a client <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Methods/GET"><code>GET</code></a>s a resource's state, modifies it and <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Methods/PUT"><code>PUT</code></a>s it back to the server, when meanwhile a third party has modified the state on the server, leading to a conflict.

      Common causes are a server that is down for maintenance or that is overloaded.
      Note that together with this response, a user-friendly page explaining the problem should be sent.
      This response should be used for temporary conditions and the <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Retry-After"><code>Retry-After</code></a> HTTP header should, if possible, contain the estimated time before the recovery of the service.

It doesn't have access to its regular origin's network, cookies, and storage data. It uses a new context local to the top-level document lifetime. In return, the Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy (COEP) embedding rules can be lifted, so documents with COEP set can embed third-party documents that do not.","popularity":0.0028,"modified":null,"other_translations":[],"pageType":"guide","source":{"folder":"en-us/web/security/iframe_credentialless","github_url":"https://github.com/mdn/content/blob/main/files/en-us/web/security/iframe_credentialless/index.md","last_commit_url":"https://github.com/mdn/content/commit/null","filename":"index.md"},"short_title":"IFrame credentialless","parents":[{"uri":"/en-US/docs/Web","title":"References"},{"uri":"/en-US/docs/Web/Security","title":"Security on the web"},{"uri":"/en-US/docs/Web/Security/IFrame_credentialless","title":"IFrame credentialless"}],"pageTitle":"IFrame credentialless - Security on the web | MDN","noIndexing":false,"hash":"0b6d6e2ca20861b8a38124aa45581725363bf3ec04926e34081dd6ea547ad52a"}

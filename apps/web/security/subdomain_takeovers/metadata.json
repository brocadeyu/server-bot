Typically, this happens when the subdomain has a canonical name (CNAME) in the Domain Name System (DNS), but no host is providing content for it. This can happen because either a virtual host hasn't been published yet or a virtual host has been removed. An attacker can take over that subdomain by providing their own virtual host and then hosting their own content for it.","popularity":0.0085,"modified":"2020-08-25T23:27:57.222Z","other_translations":[],"pageType":"guide","source":{"folder":"en-us/web/security/subdomain_takeovers","github_url":"https://github.com/mdn/content/blob/main/files/en-us/web/security/subdomain_takeovers/index.md","last_commit_url":"https://github.com/mdn/content/commit/null","filename":"index.md"},"short_title":"Subdomain takeovers","parents":[{"uri":"/en-US/docs/Web","title":"References"},{"uri":"/en-US/docs/Web/Security","title":"Security on the web"},{"uri":"/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Subdomain_takeovers","title":"Subdomain takeovers"}],"pageTitle":"Subdomain takeovers - Security on the web | MDN","noIndexing":false,"hash":"9ba1bd2692db069318009b973ce7e032f2b7e27e63527ad83d7e2a06df62e96b"}

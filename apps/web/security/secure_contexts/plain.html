<p>A <strong>secure context</strong> is a <code>Window</code> or <code>Worker</code> for which certain minimum standards of authentication and confidentiality are met. Many Web APIs and features are accessible only in a secure context. The primary goal of secure contexts is to prevent <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man-in-the-middle_attack">MITM attackers</a> from accessing powerful APIs that could further compromise the victim of an attack.</p>
<h2 id="why_should_some_features_be_restricted">Why should some features be restricted?</h2>
<p>Some APIs on the web are very powerful, giving an attacker the ability to do the following and more:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Invade a user's privacy.</li>
  <li>Get low-level access to a user's computer.</li>
  <li>Get access to data such as user credentials.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="when_is_a_context_considered_secure">When is a context considered secure?</h2>
<p>A context is considered secure when it meets certain minimum standards of authentication and confidentiality defined in the <a href="https://w3c.github.io/webappsec-secure-contexts/">Secure Contexts</a> specification. A particular document is considered to be in a secure context when it is the <a href="https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/browsers.html#active-document">active document</a> of a <a href="https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/browsers.html#top-level-browsing-context">top-level browsing context</a> (basically, a containing window or tab) that is a secure context.</p>
<p>For example, even for a document delivered over TLS within an <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/iframe"><code>&lt;iframe&gt;</code></a>, its context is <strong>not</strong> considered secure if it has an ancestor that was not also delivered over TLS.</p>
<p>However, it's important to note that if a non-secure context causes a new window to be created (with or without specifying <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/open">noopener</a>), then the fact that the opener was insecure has no effect on whether the new window is considered secure. That's because the determination of whether a particular document is in a secure context is based only on considering it within the top-level browsing context with which it is associated — and not whether a non-secure context happened to be used to create it.</p>
<p>Locally-delivered resources such as those with <code>http://127.0.0.1</code> URLs, <code>http://localhost</code> and <code>http://*.localhost</code> URLs (e.g. <code>http://dev.whatever.localhost/</code>), and <code>file://</code> URLs are also considered to have been delivered securely.</p>
<div class="notecard note">
  <p><strong>Note:</strong> Firefox 84 and later support <code>http://localhost</code> and <code>http://*.localhost</code> URLs as trustworthy origins (earlier versions did not, because <code>localhost</code> was not guaranteed to map to a local/loopback address).</p>
</div>
<p>Resources that are not local, to be considered secure, must meet the following criteria:</p>
<ul>
  <li>must be served over <code>https://</code> or <code>wss://</code> URLs</li>
  <li>the security properties of the network channel used to deliver the resource must not be considered deprecated</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="feature_detection">Feature detection</h2>
<p>Pages can use feature detection to check whether they are in a secure context or not by using the <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/isSecureContext"><code>Window.isSecureContext</code></a> or <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/API/WorkerGlobalScope/isSecureContext"><code>WorkerGlobalScope.isSecureContext</code></a> boolean, which is exposed on the global scope.</p>
<pre class="brush: js">if (window.isSecureContext) {
  // Page is a secure context so service workers are now available
  navigator.serviceWorker.register("/offline-worker.js").then(() =&gt; {
    // …
  });
}
</pre>

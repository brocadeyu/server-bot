Currently it can only contain a single value, client_mode, which specifies the context in which the app should be loaded when launched. For example, in an existing web app client containing an instance of the app, or in a new web app client. This leaves scope for more launch_handler values to be defined in the future.","popularity":0.0036,"modified":null,"other_translations":[],"pageType":"web-manifest-member","source":{"folder":"en-us/web/manifest/launch_handler","github_url":"https://github.com/mdn/content/blob/main/files/en-us/web/manifest/launch_handler/index.md","last_commit_url":"https://github.com/mdn/content/commit/null","filename":"index.md"},"short_title":"launch_handler","parents":[{"uri":"/en-US/docs/Web","title":"References"},{"uri":"/en-US/docs/Web/Manifest","title":"Web app manifests"},{"uri":"/en-US/docs/Web/Manifest/launch_handler","title":"launch_handler"}],"pageTitle":"launch_handler - Web app manifests | MDN","noIndexing":false,"hash":"3571291e6df9c9eafba883164714acb6f4e083df0e41b1b98125747811c793cf"}

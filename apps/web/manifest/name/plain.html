<h2 id="description">Description</h2>
<p>The <code>name</code> manifest member serves as the <a href="/en-US/docs/Glossary/Accessible_name">accessible name</a> for your installed app. It is displayed to users in various contexts, such as in a list of other installed web apps, as a label for your app's icon, or in the application switcher or task manager.</p>
<p>In space-constrained contexts where the full <code>name</code> may not fit, such as on a device's home screen or in the application switcher, the value of the <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/Manifest/short_name"><code>short_name</code></a> property (if defined) may be used instead.</p>
<h3 id="best_practices_for_naming_your_web_app">Best practices for naming your web app</h3>
<p>Consider the following factors when selecting a name for your web app:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Length of the name, especially if you're not providing a separate <code>short_name</code></li>
  <li>How well it indicates the purpose or nature of your app</li>
  <li>Whether it is clear and easy to understand and remember</li>
  <li>How it appears in different contexts, such as in app lists or home screen</li>
  <li>How easily it can be differentiated from other similar apps</li>
  <li>Cultural sensitivity and appropriateness for your target audience</li>
  <li>How well it translates or is perceived in different languages if your app target is a global audience</li>
  <li>Potential trademark conflicts</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="adding_a_name_for_your_web_app">Adding a name for your web app</h3>
<p>For a web app that helps users navigate trails and plan their hiking adventures, you might add the following <code>name</code> to the app manifest:</p>
<pre class="brush: json">"name": "Trail Navigator"
</pre>
<p>The app name <code>Trail Navigator</code> effectively describes the app's purpose, is easy to read and remember, and is likely to be understood by a wide audience. It uses familiar terms that outdoor enthusiasts might readily understand.</p>
<p>If you want, you can also add a <code>short_name</code>:</p>
<pre class="brush: json">"name": "Trail Navigator",
"short_name": "TrailNav"
</pre>

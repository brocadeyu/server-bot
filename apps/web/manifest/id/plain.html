<p>The <code>id</code> manifest member is used to specify a unique identifier for your web application.</p>
<h2 id="syntax">Syntax</h2>
<pre class="brush: json">/* Absolute URL */
"id": "https://example.com/myapp"

/* Relative URL */
"id": "myapp/v2"

/* URL with query parameters */
"id": "myapp?version=2&amp;mode=trial"
</pre>
<h3 id="values">Values</h3>
<dl>
  <dt id="id"><a href="#id"><code>id</code></a></dt>
  <dd>
    <p>
      A string that takes the form of a URL.
      The URL must be same-origin with the <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/Manifest/start_url"><code>start_url</code></a> of your web app.
      If <code>id</code> is a relative URL, it is resolved using the origin of <code>start_url</code>. Any fragment in the <code>id</code> is always ignored.
      If <code>id</code> is not specified or the value is invalid in any way (such as not a string, not a valid URL, not same-origin with <code>start_url</code>), the <code>start_url</code> value is used.
    </p>
  </dd>
</dl>
<h2 id="description">Description</h2>
<p>The <code>id</code> manifest member serves as a unique identifier for your web app. It allows browsers to distinguish between different applications:</p>
<ul>
  <li>When a browser comes across an app manifest with an <code>id</code> that does not correspond to an already installed application, it treats that manifest as a description of a distinct application, even if it is served from the same URL as another application.</li>
  <li>When a browser comes across an app manifest with an <code>id</code> that matches the identity of an already installed app, it treats the new manifest as a replacement for the existing app's manifest, even if the app is served from a different URL than the one installed previously.</li>
</ul>
<div class="notecard note">
  <p><strong>Note:</strong> While the <code>id</code> is processed like a URL, it does not point to a resource that can be accessed, so it is not required to be within the app's <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/Manifest/scope">scope</a>.</p>
</div>
<p>The <code>id</code> can also be used by services that collect lists of web apps to uniquely identify applications.</p>
<p>A few key points to remember while using the <code>id</code> member:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Use a leading <code>/</code> to specify that the <code>id</code> is a root-relative URL path.</li>
  <li>Since <code>id</code> is resolved against <code>start_url</code>'s origin, <code>id</code> values such as <code>../foo</code>, <code>foo</code>, <code>/foo</code>, and <code>./foo</code> all resolve to the same identifier relative to the origin. For example, if <code>start_url</code> is <code>https://example.com/app/</code>, all these <code>id</code> values will resolve to <code>https://example.com/foo/</code>.</li>
  <li>Standard URL encoding and decoding rules apply when resolving the <code>id</code> value.</li>
  <li>Fragments in the <code>id</code> are removed during processing. For example, if <code>id</code> is set to <code>foo#bar</code>, it will be resolved as <code>foo</code>. Similarly, if <code>id</code> is undefined and the <code>start_url</code> is <code>https://example.com/app/#home</code>, <code>id</code> will resolve to <code>https://example.com/app/</code>.</li>
  <li>Query parameters in the <code>id</code> are preserved and included in the final resolved identifier.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="examples">Examples</h2>
<h3 id="creating_a_distinct_app_version">Creating a distinct app version</h3>
<p>Suppose you create a web app with the following manifest:</p>
<pre class="brush: json">{
  "name": "My Weather Application",
  "id": "https://example.com/weatherapp/v1",
  "start_url": "https://example.com/app"
}
</pre>
<p>If you later create another version of this app with significant changes and want it to be treated as a different app, you can add the manifest as:</p>
<pre class="brush: json">{
  "name": "My Weather Application",
  "id": "https://example.com/weatherapp/v2",
  "start_url": "https://example.com/app"
}
</pre>
<p>In this case, even though both manifest files are served from the same URL, browsers will treat the new manifest as a description of a distinct application because the <code>id</code> is different. As a result, users can have both versions installed simultaneously.</p>
<h3 id="updating_an_existing_app">Updating an existing app</h3>
<p>Consider a scenario where you deploy a web app with the following manifest:</p>
<pre class="brush: json">{
  "name": "My Weather Application",
  "id": "https://example.com/weatherapp/",
  "start_url": "https://old-domain.com/app"
}
</pre>
<p>However, you later decide to move the app to a different domain. You would then update the manifest as follows:</p>
<pre class="brush: json">{
  "name": "My Weather Application",
  "id": "https://example.com/weatherapp/",
  "start_url": "https://new-domain.com/app"
}
</pre>
<p>Browsers will treat this new manifest as an update to the existing app because the <code>id</code> values match. In this case, users will receive an update to their existing app, rather than being prompted to install a new app.</p>
<h3 id="understanding_id_resolution">Understanding <code>id</code> resolution</h3>
<p>Assume that the <code>start_url</code> for your app is <code>https://example.com/my-app/home</code>. The following table demonstrates how different <code>id</code> values in the manifest will be resolved:</p>

  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th><code>id</code> in manifest</th>
      <th>Resolved <code>id</code></th>

    <tr>
      <td>undefined</td>
      <td><code>https://example.com/my-app/home</code></td>

      <td><code>https://example.com/foo?x=y</code></td>
      <td>Relative path resolved against <code>start_url</code>'s origin with query parameters preserved</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code>foo#heading</code></td>
      <td><code>https://example.com/foo</code></td>
      <td>Relative path resolved against <code>start_url</code>'s origin with fragment removed</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code>https://anothersite.com/foo</code></td>
      <td><code>https://example.com/my-app/home</code></td>
      <td>Cross-origin URL not allowed, falls back to <code>start_url</code></td>
    </tr>

      <td><code>https://example.com/%F0%9F%98%80</code></td>
      <td>Non-ASCII character encoded in URL</td>

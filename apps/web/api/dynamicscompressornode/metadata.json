This is often used in musical production and game audio. DynamicsCompressorNode is an AudioNode that has exactly one input and one output.","popularity":0.0011,"modified":"2020-10-15T21:22:14.771Z","other_translations":[],"pageType":"web-api-interface","source":{"folder":"en-us/web/api/dynamicscompressornode","github_url":"https://github.com/mdn/content/blob/main/files/en-us/web/api/dynamicscompressornode/index.md","last_commit_url":"https://github.com/mdn/content/commit/null","filename":"index.md"},"short_title":"DynamicsCompressorNode","parents":[{"uri":"/en-US/docs/Web","title":"References"},{"uri":"/en-US/docs/Web/API","title":"Web APIs"},{"uri":"/en-US/docs/Web/API/DynamicsCompressorNode","title":"DynamicsCompressorNode"}],"pageTitle":"DynamicsCompressorNode - Web APIs | MDN","noIndexing":false,"hash":"f15e86f8c907bc7dc18848d0dd52e1f91a071727ded2fa73c5a264b70e38a049"}

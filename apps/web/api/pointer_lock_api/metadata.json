It gives you access to raw mouse movement, locks the target of mouse events to a single element, eliminates limits on how far mouse movement can go in a single direction, and removes the cursor from view. It is ideal for first-person 3D games, for example.","popularity":0.0066,"modified":"2020-10-15T21:06:52.295Z","other_translations":[],"pageType":"web-api-overview","source":{"folder":"en-us/web/api/pointer_lock_api","github_url":"https://github.com/mdn/content/blob/main/files/en-us/web/api/pointer_lock_api/index.md","last_commit_url":"https://github.com/mdn/content/commit/null","filename":"index.md"},"short_title":"Pointer Lock API","parents":[{"uri":"/en-US/docs/Web","title":"References"},{"uri":"/en-US/docs/Web/API","title":"Web APIs"},{"uri":"/en-US/docs/Web/API/Pointer_Lock_API","title":"Pointer Lock API"}],"pageTitle":"Pointer Lock API - Web APIs | MDN","noIndexing":false,"hash":"f664929a81d0d674982d4b87a0666f82a55cbe1895b4cf01d7cef2eab3322501"}

<p>The <strong><code>DOMHighResTimeStamp</code></strong> type is a <code>double</code> and is used to store a time value in milliseconds.</p>
<p>This type can be used to describe a discrete point in time or a time interval (the difference in time between two discrete points in time). The starting time can be either a specific time determined by the script for a site or app, or the <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/API/Performance/timeOrigin">time origin</a>.</p>
<p>The time, given in milliseconds, should be accurate to 5 µs (microseconds), with the fractional part of the number indicating fractions of a millisecond. However, if the browser is unable to provide a time value accurate to 5 µs (due, for example, to hardware or software constraints), the browser can represent the value as a time in milliseconds accurate to a millisecond. Also note the section below on reduced time precision controlled by browser preferences to avoid timing attacks and <a href="/en-US/docs/Glossary/Fingerprinting">fingerprinting</a>.</p>
<p>Further, if the device or operating system the user agent is running on doesn't have a clock accurate to the microsecond level, they may only be accurate to the millisecond.</p>
<h2 id="security_requirements">Security requirements</h2>
<p>To offer protection against timing attacks and <a href="/en-US/docs/Glossary/Fingerprinting">fingerprinting</a>, <code>DOMHighResTimeStamp</code> types are coarsened based on site isolation status.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Resolution in isolated contexts: 5 microseconds</li>
  <li>Resolution in non-isolated contexts: 100 microseconds</li>
</ul>
<p>
  Cross-origin isolate your site using the <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy"><code>Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy</code></a> and
  <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy"><code>Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy</code></a> headers:
</p>
<pre class="brush: http">Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy: same-origin
Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy: require-corp
</pre>
<p>
  These headers ensure a top-level document does not share a browsing context group with
  cross-origin documents. COOP process-isolates your document and potential attackers
  can't access to your global object if they were opening it in a popup, preventing a set
  of cross-origin attacks dubbed <a href="https://github.com/xsleaks/xsleaks">XS-Leaks</a>.

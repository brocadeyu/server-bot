<p>The <strong>Broadcast Channel API</strong> allows basic communication between <a href="/en-US/docs/Glossary/Browsing_context">browsing contexts</a> (that is, <em>windows</em>, <em>tabs</em>, <em>frames</em>, or <em>iframes</em>) and workers on the same <a href="/en-US/docs/Glossary/Origin">origin</a>.</p>
<div class="notecard note">
  <p><strong>Note:</strong> To be exact, communication is allowed between browsing contexts using the same <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/Privacy/State_Partitioning">storage partition</a>. Storage is first partitioned according to top-level sitesâ€”so for example, if you have one opened page at <code>a.com</code> that embeds an iframe from <code>b.com</code>, and another page opened to <code>b.com</code>, then the iframe cannot communicate with the second page despite them being technically same-origin. However, if the first page is also on <code>b.com</code>, then the iframe can communicate with the second page.</p>
</div>
<p>By creating a <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/API/BroadcastChannel"><code>BroadcastChannel</code></a> object, you can receive any messages that are posted to it. You don't have to maintain a reference to the frames or workers you wish to communicate with: they can "subscribe" to a particular channel by constructing their own <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/API/BroadcastChannel"><code>BroadcastChannel</code></a> with the same name, and have bi-directional communication between all of them.</p>

<h3 id="creating_or_joining_a_channel">Creating or joining a channel</h3>
<p>A client joins a broadcast channel by creating a <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/API/BroadcastChannel"><code>BroadcastChannel</code></a> object. Its <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/API/BroadcastChannel/BroadcastChannel">constructor</a> takes one single parameter: the <em>name</em> of the channel. If it is the first to connect to that broadcast channel name, the underlying channel is created.</p>
<pre class="brush: js">// Connection to a broadcast channel
const bc = new BroadcastChannel("test_channel");
</pre>
<h3 id="sending_a_message">Sending a message</h3>
<p>It is enough to call the <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/API/BroadcastChannel/postMessage" title="postMessage()"><code>postMessage()</code></a> method on the created <code>BroadcastChannel</code> object, which takes any object as an argument. An example string message:</p>
<pre class="brush: js">// Example of sending of a very simple message
bc.postMessage("This is a test message.");
</pre>
<p>Data sent to the channel is serialized using the <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Workers_API/Structured_clone_algorithm">structured clone algorithm</a>. That means you can send a broad variety of data objects safely without having to serialize them yourself.</p>
<p>The API doesn't associate any semantics to messages, so it is up to the code to know what kind of messages to expect and what to do with them.</p>
<h3 id="receiving_a_message">Receiving a message</h3>
<p>When a message is posted, a <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/API/BroadcastChannel/message_event"><code>message</code></a> event is dispatched to each <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/API/BroadcastChannel"><code>BroadcastChannel</code></a> object connected to this channel. A function can be run for this event using the <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/API/BroadcastChannel/message_event" title="onmessage"><code>onmessage</code></a> event handler:</p>
<pre class="brush: js">// A handler that only logs the event to the console:
bc.onmessage = (event) =&gt; {
  console.log(event);
};
</pre>
<h3 id="disconnecting_a_channel">Disconnecting a channel</h3>
<p>To leave a channel, call the <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/API/BroadcastChannel/close" title="close()"><code>close()</code></a> method on the object. This disconnects the object from the underlying channel, allowing garbage collection.</p>
<pre class="brush: js">// Disconnect the channel
bc.close();
</pre>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>The Broadcast Channel API's self-contained interface allows cross-context communication. It can be used to detect user actions in other tabs within a same origin, like when the user logs in or out.</p>
<p>The messaging protocol is not defined and the different browsing contexts need to implement it themselves; there is no negotiation nor requirement from the specification.</p>

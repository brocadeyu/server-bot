The range includes people with mental illnesses, such as depression and schizophrenia. It also includes people with learning disabilities, such as dyslexia and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).</p>\n<p>Though there is a lot of diversity within clinical definitions of cognitive impairments, people with them experience a common set of functional problems.

For example, dementia and Alzheimer's are permanent cognitive impairments that get progressively worse. Other permanent cognitive impairments include aphasia, speech and language, autism, ADD/ADHD, dyslexia, and dyscalculia.</p>\n<p>An example of a temporary cognitive impairment could be people affected by substances such as alcohol or drugs. Another form it can take is depression, such as when mourning the loss of a loved one, or being momentarily saddened by a tweet or video they just saw online. A third example could be sleep deprivation.</p>\n<p>It may seem like an overwhelming challenge to address the wide range of cognitive differences, especially when solutions for two different people may be conflicting. One way to handle this is to focus on cognitive skills. Cognitive skills include:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>attention</li>\n  <li>memory</li>\n  <li>processing speed</li>\n  <li>time management</li>\n  <li>letters and language</li>\n  <li>numbers symbols and math</li>\n  <li>understanding and making choices</li>\n</ul>\n<p>A solid approach to providing accessible solutions for people with cognitive impairments includes:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>delivering content in more than one way, such as by text-to-speech or by video;</li>\n  <li>providing easily-understood content, such as text written using plain-language standards;</li>\n  <li>focusing attention on important content;</li>\n  <li>minimizing distractions, such as unnecessary content or advertisements;</li>\n  <li>providing consistent web page layout and navigation;</li>\n  <li>incorporating familiar elements, such as underlined links that are blue when not visited and purple when visited;</li>\n  <li>dividing processes into logical, essential steps with progress indicators;</li>\n  <li>making website authentication as easy as possible without compromising security; and</li>\n  <li>making forms easy to complete, such as with clear error messages and simple error recovery.</li>\n</ul>"}},{"type":"prose","value":{"id":"wcag_guidelines","title":"WCAG Guidelines","isH3":false,"content":"<p>WCAG, Web Content Accessibility Guidelines, includes several guidelines to improve cognitive accessibility.

To this end, they define 17 specific guidelines, of which six are especially relevant for cognitive accessibility.</p>\n<p>All of the following guidelines help more than just people with cognitive disabilities. For example, being able to extend the expiration time on an application requiring an authentication code sent to a mobile device via text message helps with the following scenarios:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>People with attention or anxiety disorders.</li>\n  <li>People who have a poor short-term memory, or who are multitasking.</li>\n  <li>People who are less technologically literate.</li>\n  <li>People who have poor wireless reception.</li>\n  <li>People who have motor control issues.</li>\n</ul>"}},{"type":"prose","value":{"id":"adaptability","title":"Adaptability","isH3":false,"content":"<p><a href=\"https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/adaptable\" class=\"external\" target=\"_blank\">Guideline 1.3</a> states \"content should be <strong>adaptable</strong>\".

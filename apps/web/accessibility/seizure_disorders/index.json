Content that flickers, flashes, or blinks can trigger photosensitive epilepsy. Web technologies that use video, animated GIFs, animated PNGs, animated SVGs, <a href=\"/en-US/docs/Glossary/Canvas\">Canvas</a>, and CSS or JavaScript animations can all produce content that may induce seizures or other incapacitating physical reactions. Certain visual patterns, especially stripes, can also cause physical reactions even though they are not animated. Photosensitive epilepsy is actually a kind of \"reflex epilepsy\"—seizures occurring in response to a trigger. In the case of photosensitive epilepsy, seizures are triggered specifically by flashing lights, but other types of reflex epilepsies may be triggered by the act of reading or by noises. Patterns and images can also trigger epilepsy.</p>\n<p>The fact that static images may cause seizures and other disorders is documented in articles such as <a href=\"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0960982217304062\" class=\"external\" target=\"_blank\">\"Gamma Oscillations and photosensitive epilepsy\"</a>, where it is noted \"<em>Certain visual images, even in the absence of motion or flicker, can trigger seizures in patients with photosensitive epilepsy</em>\". The Epilepsy Foundation, in its article, <a href=\"https://www.epilepsy.com/stories/shedding-light-photosensitivity-one-epilepsys-most-complex-conditions-0\" class=\"external\" target=\"_blank\">\"Shedding Light on Photosensitivity, One of Epilepsy's Most Complex Conditions\"</a> talks about static images and patterns: \"<em>Static or moving patterns of discernible light and dark stripes have the same effect as flashing lights because of the alternation of dark and bright areas.\"</em> The Epilepsy Foundation of America Working Group is able to \"quantify\" the problem a little: <em>\"A pattern with the potential for provoking seizures contains clearly discernible stripes, numbering more than five light-dark pairs of stripes in any orientation</em>\". In addition to stripes, checkered patterns have also been known to cause photosensitive seizures, according to <a href=\"https://www.cedars-sinai.org/health-library/diseases-and-conditions/p/photosensitive-seizures.html\" class=\"external\" target=\"_blank\">Cedars-Sinai</a>.</p>\n<p>Although static images are possible as triggers, they are less consistent. The trigger that is well established and strong is flashing/strobe lights. Dr. Selim Benbadis of USF's Comprehensive Epilepsy Program notes, <em>\"The only thing that is really documented is flashing lights, which can trigger seizures in patients with photosensitive epilepsy. Only a few types of epilepsies are photosensitive though, and the vast majority of epilepsies are not.\"</em> In addition to seizures brought about by photosensitivity, listening to certain pieces of music can also trigger what are called musicogenic seizures, although these types of seizures seem to be much more rare. For a great introduction on the topic of musicogenic seizures, visit Epilepsy Ontario's web page on <a href=\"https://epilepsyontario.org/musicogenic-seizures/\" class=\"external\" target=\"_blank\">Musicogenic Seizures</a>.</p>\n<p>Seizures and epilepsy are not the same. In its article <a href=\"https://www.epilepsy.com/stories/revised-definition-epilepsy\" class=\"external\" target=\"_blank\">\"A Revised Definition of Epilepsy\"</a>, the Epilepsy Foundation notes that \"<em>a seizure is an event and epilepsy is the disease involving recurrent unprovoked seizures</em>.\" According to the Epilepsy Foundation's page <a href=\"https://www.epilepsy.com/what-is-epilepsy/understanding-seizures/how-serious-are-seizures\" class=\"external\" target=\"_blank\">\"How Serious Are Seizures?\"</a>, <em>\"Sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP) is likely the most common disease-related cause of death in with epilepsy. It is not frequent but it is a very real problem and people need to be aware of its risk\"</em>.</p>\n<p>The point is, seizures most definitely can be and are fatal, and developers and designers are incredibly important for making the web a safer place for those with sensitivities to photosensitive or musicogenic triggers.</p>\n<p>Seizures can be fatal, but even the ones that are \"only\" debilitating can be of such severity that they render the user incapacitated. Other disorders, such as disorientation, nausea, vomiting, and more can also be so severe that the user is unable to function. The Epilepsy Foundation's article, <a href=\"https://www.epilepsy.com/what-is-epilepsy/seizure-triggers/photosensitivity\" class=\"external\" target=\"_blank\">\"Photosensitivity and Seizures\"</a>, provides a list of triggers that may cause seizures in photosensitive people; here's an excerpt from that list:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>Television screens or computer monitors due to the flicker or rolling images.</li>\n  <li>Certain video games or TV broadcasts containing rapid flashes or alternating patterns of different colors.</li>\n  <li>Intense strobe lights like visual fire alarms.</li>\n  <li>Natural light, such as sunlight, especially when shimmering off water, flickering through trees or through the slats of Venetian blinds.</li>\n  <li>Certain visual patterns, especially stripes of contrasting colors.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>That same article continues that many factors must combine to trigger the photosensitive reaction. Of note is that it includes the wavelength of light as a possible factor; wavelengths in the red part of the spectrum seem to be especially problematic. In the article, <a href=\"https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/seizure-does-not-violate.html\" class=\"external\" target=\"_blank\">\"Understanding WCAG 2.0 Three Flashes or Below Threshold\"</a> notes generally that: <em>\"Individuals who have photosensitive seizure disorders can have a seizure triggered by content that flashes at certain frequencies for more than a few flashes\"</em> and goes on to note, very specifically that: \"<em>People are even more sensitive to red flashing than to other colors, so a special test is provided for saturated red flashing</em>\".</p>\n<p>You don't even need an image or video to cause harm. A <a href=\"/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/div\"><code>&lt;div&gt;</code></a> element set to change color and luminosity at high frequency, easily done via JavaScript, can cause real harm. And, flickering can occur everywhere. For example, \"spinners\" commonly used to display while pages load can easily \"flicker\" while spinning.</p>\n<p>Additional concerns exist for individuals with motor-skill problems. For example, the page for Trace Research &amp; Development Center's <a href=\"https://trace.umd.edu/peat/\" class=\"external\" target=\"_blank\">Photosensitive Epilepsy Analysis Tool</a> notes that <em>\"Photosensitive seizures can be provoked by certain types of flashing in web or computer content, including mouse-overs that cause large areas of the screen to rapidly flash on and off repeatedly\"</em>.</p>"}},{"type":"prose","value":{"id":"other_physical_reactions","title":"Other physical reactions","isH3":true,"content":"<p>Nausea, vertigo (or dizziness), and disorientation are very nonspecific symptoms associated with all kinds of diseases and not particularly suggestive of seizures (except maybe disorientation, which is seen in seizures).

Some of the children watching the cartoon reacted by having seizures, others by suffering nausea, shaking, and vomiting blood.

NASA, in its document titled, <a href=\"https://colorusage.arc.nasa.gov/flashing.php\" class=\"external\" target=\"_blank\">\"Blinking, Flashing, and Temporal Response\"</a> notes that blinking and flashing can be powerful tools for drawing attention—as is necessary for warning buttons (this assumes that users can still see the screen while elements are flashing, which is not always true). For some users, blinking buttons also caution that they must be used sparingly, and with care.

When the light-dark stripes of any pattern collectively subtend at the eye from the minimal-expected viewing distance a solid angle of &gt;0.006 steradians, the luminance of the lightest stripe is &gt;50 cd/m2, and the pattern is presented for ≥0.5 s, then the pattern should display no more than five light-dark pairs of stripes, if the stripes change direction, oscillate, flash, or reverse in contrast; if the pattern is unchanging or smoothly drifting in one direction, no more than eight stripes. These principles are easier to apply in the case of fixed media, for example, a prerecorded TV show, which can be analyzed frame-by-frame, as compared with interactive media.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The \"cd/m<sup>2</sup>\" refers to candela per square meter. So for the web developer, how does this relate to measurements for color, luminance, and saturation?</p>\n<p>The candela is a SI unit (International System of units) of luminous intensity. It's a photometric term, and photometry deals with the measurement of visible light as perceived by human eyes. Wikipedia's article on <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Candela_per_square_metre\" class=\"external\" target=\"_blank\">\"Candela per square metre\"</a> puts it in terms of what we are familiar with as developers: on a display device, and in the RGB space. This is helpful, because there's a specific standard assumed to be used on monitors, printers, and the Internet, and it is the <strong>sRGB</strong> (standard Red Green Blue).</p>\n<blockquote>\n  <p>As a measure of light emitted per unit area, this unit is frequently used to specify the brightness of a display device. The <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SRGB\" class=\"external\" target=\"_blank\">sRGB</a> spec for monitors targets 80 cd/m<sup>2</sup>.<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Candela_per_square_metre#cite_note-3\" class=\"external\" target=\"_blank\"><sup>[3]</sup></a> Typically, calibrated monitors should have a brightness of 120 cd/m<sup>2</sup>. Most consumer desktop <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquid_crystal_display\" class=\"external\" target=\"_blank\">liquid crystal displays</a> have luminances of 200 to 300 cd/m<sup>2</sup>.<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Candela_per_square_metre#cite_note-4\" class=\"external\" target=\"_blank\"><sup>[4]</sup></a> <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-definition_television\" class=\"external\" target=\"_blank\">High-definition televisions</a> range from 450 to about 1500 cd/m<sup>2</sup>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The takeaway is that the <strong>sRGB</strong> color space is a common touch point between research, assessment tools, and developers, since it is easily converted from the commonly used Hex code.</p>"}},{"type":"prose","value":{"id":"human_physiology_and_psychology_as_a_consideration","title":"Human physiology and psychology as a consideration","isH3":true,"content":"<p>Many experts work to quantify and measure to the greatest extent possible the kinds of web content that can serve as triggers for seizures. That said, it can't be forgotten that color is as much about human perception in the brain as it is the measurement of light coming from a computer screen.</p>\n<p>In addition to the psychological variances, there are also physiological differences among us. There will be variances and nuances as to how a real human being perceives, and responds to, color and light. For example, Tom Jewett, Lecturer Emeritus of Computer Sciences at Cal State University Long Beach, notes the following concerning <a href=\"https://colortutorial.design/hsb.html\" class=\"external\" target=\"_blank\">lightness in the HSL color scale</a> <em>\"…The distinction between levels of lightness is not actually linear as the HSL scale would imply; we are much more sensitive to changes in lighter values than to darker ones.\"</em></p>\n<p>It's important to understand that light and its measurements are linear, but human vision and human perception are not. Investigation and discussion is ongoing as to how to relate the machine measurement of light as it passes from a computer screen, through the distance to the human eye, filtered by human vision, and then manipulated through the human brain.</p>\n<p>Even age and sex can play a role. According to the Epilepsy Foundation's article, <a href=\"https://www.epilepsy.com/stories/shedding-light-photosensitivity-one-epilepsys-most-complex-conditions-0\" class=\"external\" target=\"_blank\">\"Shedding Light on Photosensitivity, One of Epilepsy's Most Complex Conditions\"</a>, <em>\"Children and adolescents are more prone than adults to have an abnormal response to light stimulation, and the first light-induced seizure almost always occurs before age 20\".</em> The article follows with this statistic: <em>\"Girls (60 percent) are more often affected than boys (40 percent), although seizures are more frequent in boys because they are more likely to be playing video games. Video games often contain potentially provocative light stimulation\"</em>.</p>\n<p><strong>User testing is very problematic</strong>. Naturally, no one wants to subject a seizure-prone individual to user testing. It's dangerous. To that point, one of the most ethical thing that developers and designers can do is use tools that have been developed by experts in the field who have worked hand-in-hand with physicians to develop the tool.

Animation speed is controlled within the gif image itself. Converting an animated gif to video enables controls to be put on the animation, and gives the user agency. There are many free online converters available for use, such as <a href=\"https://ezgif.com/\" class=\"external\" target=\"_blank\">EZGif</a> and <a href=\"https://gif-2-mp4.com/\" class=\"external\" target=\"_blank\">GIF to MP4</a>.</p>\n<h4 id=\"set_user_expectations\">Set user expectations</h4>\n<p>Give users a heads-up as to what will happen before they click on that link.

Generally speaking, limit the size of the flash to an area approximately 341 by 256 pixels or less. This pixel size assumes that a viewer is at a typical distance from the screen. As mentioned earlier, this size may be too big if the image is to be viewed at close range, such as in a VR headset. WebVR is an open specification that makes it possible to experience VR in your browser. WebVR can be experienced on phone, computer or headset.</p>\n<p>If you are designing for a game or VR that uses an ocular mask, <strong>or CAN be used by an ocular mask</strong>, such as in Firefox Reality (a browser for virtual reality), ensure that the size of the rectangle is much smaller than 341 by 256 pixels, because the image is much closer to a user's eyes.</p>\n<h4 id=\"reduce_contrast\">Reduce contrast</h4>\n<p>Normally, higher contrast is a good thing when it comes to accessibility.

Users with low vision are especially appreciative of efforts to ensure high contrast of text against its background. When the content is animated, however, <strong><em>reducing</em></strong> contrast is actually a way to reduce the likelihood that the animated content will cause seizures. Drop the contrast ratio if three flashes within one second are detected.</p>\n<p>The contrast ratio is defined in <a href=\"https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/\" class=\"external\" target=\"_blank\">WCAG 2.1</a> as follows:</p>\n<dl>\n  <dt id=\"contrast_ratio\"><a href=\"#contrast_ratio\"><em>contrast ratio</em></a></dt>\n  <dd>\n    <p>(L1 + 0.05) / (L2 + 0.05), where</p>\n    <ul>\n      <li>L1 is the <a href=\"https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#dfn-relative-luminance\" class=\"external\" target=\"_blank\">relative luminance</a> of the lighter of the colors, and</li>\n      <li>L2 is the <a href=\"https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#dfn-relative-luminance\" class=\"external\" target=\"_blank\">relative luminance</a> of the darker of the colors.</li>\n    </ul>\n  </dd>\n</dl>\n<p>It's best if you can adjust the contrast before it is uploaded or published to the web. For videos and animated GIFs, the Adobe Suite of products is a phenomenal resource for traditional images. Also for images, an online tool available is pinetools.com's <a href=\"https://pinetools.com/brightness-contrast-image\" class=\"external\" target=\"_blank\">Brightness and contrast online</a>. If you intend to make animated GIFs, for example, start with one that has a lower contrast ratio.</p>\n<p>JavaScript is also an option for reducing contrast dynamically. Here's a code example from the section titled, <a href=\"/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document_Object_Model/Traversing_an_HTML_table_with_JavaScript_and_DOM_Interfaces#setting_the_background_color_of_a_paragraph\">\"Example: Setting the background color of a paragraph\"</a> from the MDN document, <a href=\"/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document_Object_Model/Traversing_an_HTML_table_with_JavaScript_and_DOM_Interfaces\">Traversing an HTML table with JavaScript and DOM Interfaces</a>.

Among their results was the understanding that <em>\"A flash is a potential hazard if it has luminance at least 20 cd/m2, occurs at a frequency of least 3 Hz, and occupies a solid visual angle of at least 0.006 steradians (about 10% of the central visual field or 25% of screen area at typical viewing distances).

In some cases, the alternate styles are revealed when the users go through the View menu, in other cases they are manifested in the settings, sometimes both. Not all users know to look for these options via the browser or settings, so it's worth considering doing things the old-fashioned way, with obvious buttons or links to change the style so that users can see them.

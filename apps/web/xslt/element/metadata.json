A top-level element must appear as the child of either <xsl:stylesheet> or <xsl:transform>. An instruction, on the other hand, is associated with a template. A stylesheet may include several templates. A third type of element, not discussed here, is the literal result element (LRE). An LRE also appears in a template. It consists of any non-instruction element that should be copied as-is to the result document, for example, an <hr> element in an HTML conversion stylesheet.","popularity":0.001,"modified":"2019-03-24T00:14:46.715Z","other_translations":[],"pageType":"landing-page","source":{"folder":"en-us/web/xslt/element","github_url":"https://github.com/mdn/content/blob/main/files/en-us/web/xslt/element/index.md","last_commit_url":"https://github.com/mdn/content/commit/null","filename":"index.md"},"short_title":"XSLT elements reference","parents":[{"uri":"/en-US/docs/Web","title":"References"},{"uri":"/en-US/docs/Web/XSLT","title":"XSLT: Extensible Stylesheet Language Transformations"},{"uri":"/en-US/docs/Web/XSLT/Element","title":"XSLT elements reference"}],"pageTitle":"XSLT elements reference - XSLT: Extensible Stylesheet Language Transformations | MDN","noIndexing":false,"hash":"3a3b204f9ca204022a5ba1116edfbac748bc6f9b0eb966c1cee3c089ec2b71b4"}

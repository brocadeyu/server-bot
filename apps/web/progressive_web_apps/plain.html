<p>A <strong>progressive web app</strong> (PWA) is an app that's built using web platform technologies, but that provides a user experience like that of a platform-specific app.</p>
<p>Like a website, a PWA can run on multiple platforms and devices from a single codebase. Like a platform-specific app, it can be installed on the device, can operate while offline and in the background, and can integrate with the device and with other installed apps.</p>
<h2 id="guides">Guides</h2>
<p>These guides give conceptual explanations of different aspects of PWAs. They're intended to help you understand what kinds of things are possible with PWAs, and to provide enough pointers to help you understand how to achieve them.</p>

    <p>One of the defining aspects of a PWA is that it can be installed on the device, and then appears to users as a platform-specific app, a permanent feature of their device which they can launch directly from the operating system like any other app. In this guide we'll explore what "installable" means, what a PWA needs to provide for it to be installable, and how you can customize the install experience.</p>

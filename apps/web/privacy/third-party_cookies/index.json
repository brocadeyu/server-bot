A user can sign in to any of those sites, creating a cookie set on the browser for <code>auth.site</code> containing a session ID. When the user goes to one of the other sites, the embedded <code>auth.site</code> instance will have access to the session ID cookie set when the user signs in on the first site. It can send that to the server, check it is still valid, and sign in to that site immediately.</p>\n<p>\n  <img src=\"https://mdn.github.io/shared-assets/images/diagrams/http/cookies/3pc-example.png\" alt=\"visual representation of the above third-party sign-in system description\" loading=\"lazy\">\n</p>"}},{"type":"prose","value":{"id":"what_is_the_problem_with_third-party_cookies","title":"What is the problem with third-party cookies?","isH3":false,"content":"<p>The above use cases sound innocent enough.

Google has started to disable third-party cookies for a limited percentage of Chrome users to test the impact that will have, while at the same time developing technologies to enable key use cases without requiring third-party cookies.

If you don't specify <code>SameSite</code> in your <code>Set-Cookie</code> headers, the default value, <code>Lax</code>, is used. This instructs the browser to not send third-party cookies except when the user navigates to the cookie's origin site from a different site. This is useful when you want to send cookies straight away as soon as a user navigates to your site from another site, to for example personalize the experience as soon as they get there.</p>\n<p>However, it is no good if you want to embed cross-site content across multiple sites inside <code>&lt;iframe&gt;</code>s and rely on third-party cookies for functionality, for example in the case of the sign-in example we looked at above.

<html><head></head><body><p>Google's <strong>privacy sandbox</strong> project is a series of proposals to satisfy cross-site use cases without requiring third-party cookies or other tracking mechanisms, preparing for a future web in which third-party cookies have been removed. Themes include identity and tracking protection, more privacy-respecting ad solutions, preventing covert tracking, and safely sharing data across browsing contexts.</p>

<dl>
  <dt id="attribution_reporting_api"><a href="/en-US/docs/Web/API/Attribution_Reporting_API">Attribution Reporting API</a></dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Enables developers to measure conversions — for example when a user clicks an ad embedded on one site and then proceeds to purchase the item over on the vendor's site — and then access reports on those conversions. It does this without relying on third-party tracking cookies.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt id="cookies_having_independent_partitioned_state_chips"><a href="/en-US/docs/Web/Privacy/Privacy_sandbox/Partitioned_cookies">Cookies Having Independent Partitioned State (CHIPS)</a></dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Also known as <strong>partitioned cookies</strong>, CHIPs allows developers to opt a cookie into partitioned storage, with a separate cookie jar per top-level site.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt id="fenced_frame_api"><a href="/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fenced_frame_API">Fenced Frame API</a></dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Provides functionality for controlling content embedded in <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/fencedframe"><code>&lt;fencedframe&gt;</code></a> elements, which enable content to be embedded while solving the privacy issues of <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/iframe"><code>&lt;iframe&gt;</code></a>s.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt id="related_website_sets"><a href="/en-US/docs/Web/API/Storage_Access_API/Related_website_sets">Related website sets</a></dt>
  <dd>
    <p>A mechanism for a company to declare relationships between different sites. Supporting browsers will then allow limited third-party cookie access across those sites for specific purposes, via the <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/API/Storage_Access_API">Storage Access API</a>.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt id="shared_storage_api"><a href="/en-US/docs/Web/API/Shared_Storage_API">Shared Storage API</a></dt>
  <dd>
    <p>A client-side storage mechanism that enables unpartitioned, cross-site data access while preserving privacy (i.e. without relying on tracking cookies).</p>
  </dd>
  <dt id="topics_api"><a href="/en-US/docs/Web/API/Topics_API">Topics API</a></dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Provides a mechanism for developers to implement use cases such as <strong>interest-based advertising (IBA)</strong> based on topics collected by the browser as the user navigates different pages, rather than collected by the developer by tracking the user's journey around different sites with third-party cookies.</p>

<dl>
  <dt id="privacy_sandbox_enrollment"><a href="/en-US/docs/Web/Privacy/Privacy_sandbox/Enrollment">Privacy sandbox enrollment</a></dt>
  <dd>
    <p>To access certain privacy sandbox features, developers must complete an <strong>enrollment</strong> process.</p>
